# A Letter to Her

*It’s You. It’s Always Been You.*

Hey,

Do you remember the first time we met?

That conversation about Zodiac signs?

I do. I remember it vividly.

Every memory with you feels as clear as if it happened yesterday

Because the memories of you exist outside of time.

\

I’ve only ever known what it feels like to fall hard.

Maybe that’s why I never fully understood the love I had for you.

Falling gradually, softly, was different—so different that I didn’t realize it was love until it consumed me.

\

I discovered my passion because of you.

I rediscovered myself because of you.

Oooh, I code because of you.

\

At my lowest, you were the one I talked to.

When I made my worst decision, you were the only one who warned me.

My turning point, my rise from the ashes was because of you.

Oooh, I wish you could be there at my best, to see the version of me you inspired.

\

When the chaos of this world overwhelms me, I imagine you by my side.

Your smile.

Your eyes.

Your lips.

Your dreadlocks.

Your scent.

All of you.

\

If only the world hadn’t stolen 2020 from us.

Just when I was finally willing to step out of my comfort zone...

Maybe, just maybe, we would have been.

\

I probably will never know what your perspective of our time together was.

Maybe you’ve forgotten, or maybe it was never as significant for you as it was for me.

But to me, those moments were everything.

You showed me a kind of love that didn’t demand, didn’t push, didn’t rush—but simply existed.

And even if our paths never cross again, you’ll always be the one I remember when the world goes quiet.

*It’s you. It’s always been you.*
