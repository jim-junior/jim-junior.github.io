The **Art of Programming** is an intensely mental endeavor. Developers must conceptualize both what they want to create and how to bring it to life entirely in their minds. Unlike other creative fields that produce tangible products, software is intangible. We don’t interact with the software itself but rather with the outcomes it enables or the problems it solves. Because of this unique nature, designing tools for software creation demands a deep understanding of how developers think and work during the development process.

Developer tools, whether SDKs, CLIs, or frameworks are themselves software products, but they serve a fundamentally different purpose from consumer-facing applications. They are built for a technical audience, with the primary goal of helping developers solve specific problems. If your aim is to create a tool that serves a wide range of developers, understanding the cognitive processes involved in problem-solving is crucial. This is where cognitive modeling comes into play.

> Cognitive modeling is a field in computer science that simulates how humans think, reason, and solve problems. By predicting user behavior and improving human-computer interactions, cognitive modeling helps refine tools and platforms making them intuitive and effective for their intended audience.

In this article, we’ll explore how cognitive modeling has been and can be used to design successful software platforms for technical audiences. We’ll examine real-world examples where cognitive modeling has played a key role in the success of technologies, focusing on [React](https://react.dev/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), two tools developed at Meta (formerly Facebook). Despite competing against more powerful, established alternatives, these tools rapidly gained widespread adoption due to their intuitive design and developer-centric approach.

We’ll also discuss how emerging technologies leverage cognitive modeling to challenge world-class, established tools, and how legacy platforms are adapting to remain relevant. Together, these examples will highlight the transformative power of cognitive modeling in the design and development of software tools.
