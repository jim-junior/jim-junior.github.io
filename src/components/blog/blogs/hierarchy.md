# Institution, Hierarchy and the myth of Individualism



I've been thinking of the Dark Era, 10^100 years from now. When the last black hole releases the last hawking radiation. Low energy particles floating through the infinite universe. A point of maximum entropy. What next. Is that all. The trillions of lives, consciousnesses, the meaning. Will all that be gone and all for nothing. I hope not. Mainly because my life, ambitions and goals can't, and I believe wont be for nothing.
