# Institution, Hierarchy and the myth of Individualism

> Article might remain a work in progress

I've been thinking of the Dark Era, 10^100 years from now. When the last black hole releases the last hawking radiation. Low energy particles floating through the infinite universe. A point of maximum entropy. What next. Is that all. The trillions of lives, consciousnesses, the meaning. Will all that be gone and all for nothing. I hope not. Mainly because my life, ambitions and goals can't, and I believe wont be for nothing. 

One of my inner most thought i have always had from childhood was the **nothing**. No existence, it was both scary and almost impossible to comprehend in my brain. I remember in Primary 4, at a small christian school next to lake victoria, Team Christian School, I always tried to debate internally the existence of God. Core at my debate was the concept of the before the beginning, before God. What existed, or more of what didnt exist.
