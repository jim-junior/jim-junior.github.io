2a:T402, that defines the expected resource usage for the task during execution. This acts as heuristic that helps the driver runtime decide whether a certain driver instance is allowed to run the task. It compares the available host node system resources and evaluates whether running that task will not cause resource contention or Out of Memory Errors. This constraint based scheduling considers any node as long as adding the task won't exit 100 percent usage of the resources, that's to say, even if a node is using up to 90% of its resources and adding the task will push it to 99% it will still schedule it on that node. it also tends to prioritize driver instances running on nodes with lower resource usage than the others, say if node A is using 60% and node B is using 55%, it's more likely to consider node B than A. But this will not always be the case, sometimes other factors might cause us to consider node A. Such a mechanism will ensure that the possibility of node failures due to resource contention is really low.15:["$","$L8",null,{"sx":{"my":1.5,"width":"100%","fontFamily":"charter, serif","lineHeight":1.7,"fontSize":"1.125rem","textAlign":"inherit","hyphens":"auto"},"level":"body-lg","children":["Within the tasks Resource specification, I introduced an optional field called ",["$","code",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace","fontSize":"0.875em","color":"var(--joy-palette-success-600)","borderRadius":"4px"},"children":"resourceUsage"}],"$2a"]}]

By combining FIFO, priority-based, and constraint-aware scheduling with a distributed model powered by JetStream, I’ve managed to create a system that not only prevents resource overloads but also opens the door for true horizontal scaling and more features like fault tolorence. This isn’t just a theoretical improvement—it directly addresses real-world pain points for teams running concurrent workloads on shared infrastructure. There’s still room to refine and optimize, but this foundation sets the stage for building CI/CD systems that are both resilient and adaptive under pressure. This might be the greatest improvement to Conveyor CI yet."}]
