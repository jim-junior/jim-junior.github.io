The Entry guard then connects to another relay called Middle Relay which also connects to another Middle Relay. The last relay in the chain is the Exist Relay which connects to the website. Each relay knows only the previous system and the next one, but never the whole chain. In the point of view of the website, it's being accessed through Tor and is aware of the address of the Exit Relay but cannot know anything else beyond that.
