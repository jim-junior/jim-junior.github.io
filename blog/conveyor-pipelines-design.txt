Mainly is that there is no order of execution of drivers upon a Resource. This means that once a Resource event occurs, all drivers execute their corresponding actions whenever they receive the event and they do this in no orderly fashion. This means it is not possible to predict what action will occur at what point in the CI/CD process and you also can’t create dependency actions that depend on others being pre-executed. An example is if you have a workflow whereby you compile your source code then upload the output program to a distribution server, You might have two drivers, one for compiling and another for uploading. In the current implementation, these drivers will execute at once, yet the uploading driver should depend on the constraint that the compiling driver is done executing."}]

Just like Rome wasn't built in a day, You can build a Cloud native software framework in a short period of time. As I keep learning more about software, from my Software Engineering Degree I am pursuing, the Internet and other Cloud Native projects and Engineers, I will keep applying those innovative ideas to the Conveyor CI project.
