Orbiton achieves this by using clean code and prevents unnecessary operations. When it comes to matters concerning portability, Orbiton’s core packages is written in universal JavaScript that can run in all JavaScript environments be it Node, Deno and in the browser. This makes it possible for you to run Orbiton in any platform and Orbiton has the concept of registering a custom renderer making it possible to ship Orbiton in any other platform like mobile. Orbiton was also built to easily adopt to the JavaScript Ecosystem by making it easy for Orbiton developers to utilize common JavaScript tools like webpack, babel and other tools. To archive this Orbiton has a set of utils like the official babel plugin and an SWC plugin( comming soon ) that transform JSX to Orbiton functions."}]

Orbiton has also created the Orbiton-server package to enable server side Rendering in Orbiton.
