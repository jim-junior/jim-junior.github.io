# World View

I Initially wanted to write this as one blog post, but considering the ideas written in this document come up at random points in time, i have decided to adopt sam altmans writing style of back then when he was starting to write, by writing short, meaningfull articles. All in one document

## 1. Hierarchy

You've finished a level of life and find yourself at the lowest playing level of the stage your in. You have to climb this hierarchy to the top. You've set a goal, and you will do anything to achieve it. The top of your hierarchy is achieving your goal. Youve joined an new team, being team leader is your goal, joined a new company, being at the top on the company is your goal. Maximum money, **POWER**, fame, knowledge etc, what ever it is, it can all be seen as a game of hierarcies. And your a player at level one. This is how the world is built. Or maybe how I see it in my world view.

So question is, how do you climb up this hierarchy? See there is no one method, ngl I dont think i know the right answer, but i have a playbook, one that has been perfected over millions of years, actually billions.

## 2. Institution

## 3. The Myth Of Individualism
